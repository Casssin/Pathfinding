# Pathfinding
A bad C++ pathfinding algorithm using SDL2

Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to guarntee the shortest path

Controls: <br>
Mouse1: Add walls <br>
LShift: Add starting point <br>
Z: Add ending point <br>
X: Delete point (Must delete starting/ending point in order to create another one) <br>
D: Erase board <br>
1: Start the Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithim <br>
2: Start the a* pathfinding algorithim (still buggy)<br>
